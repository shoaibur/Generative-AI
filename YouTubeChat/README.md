# Overview
**`YouTubeChat`** is a Python-based chatbot that interacts with users based on the content of a specified YouTube video transcript. Utilizing the power of the OpenAI model and FAISS for similarity search, it provides answers derived from the video's transcript, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant responses.

# Purpose
The main purpose of **`YouTubeChat`** is to:
* Allow users to query specific details or topics from a YouTube video without watching the entire video.
* Provide an interactive means for users to gain insights or information from the content of the video.
* Serve as an educational or informational tool, especially beneficial when dealing with long or dense videos.

# Usage
To use YouTubeChat, you need to:
* Initialize an object of the class with the desired YouTube video URL.
* Use the interactive_chat() method to start the chat session.
* Example:
    ```
    video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sampleURL"
    youtube_chat = YouTubeChat(video_url)
    youtube_chat.interactive_chat()
    ```

# Features
* **Transcript Extraction**: It uses YoutubeLoader to fetch and process the transcript of the provided YouTube video URL.

* **Dynamic Content Splitting**: The video transcript is split into manageable chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter ensuring optimized and accurate search.

* **Similarity Search**: Utilizes FAISS for efficient similarity search. This ensures that the model provides answers that are most relevant to the user's query.

* **Interactive Session**: Users can interact with the chatbot in a session format. The chatbot remembers previous interactions, providing context-aware answers.

* **Verbose & Detailed Responses**: Designed to provide detailed answers. If an instruction regarding answer length is given, it adheres to it.

# Methods
* **create_db_from_youtube_video_url(url)**: Fetches and processes the YouTube video transcript, then creates a FAISS database from it.

* **get_response_from_query(query, k=4)**: Accepts a user query and returns a response based on the video transcript. Also keeps track of chat history for context.

* **interactive_chat()**: Initiates an interactive chat session. Users can keep asking questions, and to end the session, they can type 'exit'.

# Limitations
* The chatbot is heavily reliant on the availability and accuracy of the YouTube video transcript. If the transcript is not available or is not clear, the chatbot's performance may degrade.

* While the model aims to provide verbose and detailed answers, the accuracy is still dependent on the model's understanding and the content of the video transcript.

# Conclusion
**`YouTubeChat`** offers a unique way to interact with YouTube video content, making it easier for users to retrieve and understand information. Whether for educational purposes or just to get a quick summary or detail from a video, it serves as a valuable tool.
